### Lapse App

My first ever Rails app, developed independently.

It allows users to add memories (word and image snippets) to a capsule and set a time in the future before which they do not want to see the content again.

Users are provided with a personal capsule, but can add friends to share snippets privately, and create groups to share between multiple people.
